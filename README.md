# 🎬 Movie Recommendation System using Machine Learning

This project is a Movie Recommendation System developed using Machine Learning techniques in Python. It recommends similar movies based on content similarity by analyzing features such as genres, keywords, cast, crew, and overview.

The system uses text vectorization and cosine similarity to measure the closeness between movies. It is implemented using Python and popular data science libraries and demonstrated through a Jupyter Notebook.
